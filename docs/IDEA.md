## Team Tasks

Think through:

- Game mechanics
  - Impacts of choice
  - player state?
  - Time? Location?
  - Difficulty
  - Victory and loss conditions
  - Death
  - Inability to accomplish goal
  - Length of play (5-10m for a single play through)
- Narrative tone
  - Dytopian
  - Informative (but also satirical)
  - Make sure we don't go too overboard to the point that we exaggerate 2025 to the point that it makes people take 2025 _less_ seriously
    - We want the right level of dystopia: convey the seriousness, but don't create a strawman.
  - Should there be a path to hope / actions for fighting against impact of 2025?
    - Hope can be personal, OR systemic.
- Game story arc
- Asset types
  - Events
  - Legislation
  - Choices
  - Items
    - Food
    - Medicine
    - Entertainment
    - Real Estate
    - ...?
  - Goals
  - Identities
  - Newspaper articles
  - Careers
  - Jobs
  - Activities
    - Education
    - Leisure
    - Work
  - Conditions
- Music / sound
- Images / art
- UI / UX -- how is this being presented
  - Guide
  - What's the hook! (something that grabs people within 10 seconds)
  - Summary / scorecard after you play (that you can share)
